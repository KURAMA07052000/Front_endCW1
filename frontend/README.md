Firstly clone the repository as follows

 git init

 git clone https://github.com/KURAMA07052000/Front_endCW1.git

 cd FRONT_ENDWEBCW1

-------------------------------HOW TO RUN-----------------------------------------
1. To start the application follow these steps:

 cd backend

 node index


2. Then go to the frontend by opening a new terminal using '+'

 cd frontend

 npm install

 npm i

 npm start

3. Now the website should be fully loaded on local host port 3000.

4. On a new chromium browser(Chrome, edge, firefox et....) enter http://localhost:3000/

-------------------------------ADDED FUNCTIONALITY-----------------------------------------

1. The user can effectively bookmark recipes and it will save it localy on client-side. Thne user can also delete these items and the changes will be reflected localy as well.

2. There is an effective navigation system that allows user to reach parts within the page and a button by the right to send them back to the top.

4. The program sucessfully reads data from the back-end and can use the name to query the API for further data. This is reflected in the user cards system

5. The rating system passes an array that is averaged on client side to show the mean of all th values within the array. This also succesfully pases new entries to the bakend and in turn updates the data.

6. The user can use checkboxes to filter the menu out in regards to category such as snack, lunch, drin and so on.

7. the user can use the searchbar at the top to either filter results by name or ingredients

8. The website utilises responsive design to all kinds of devices


-------------------------------CHANGES TO DESIGN DOCUMENT-----------------------------------------

1. I changed the length and format of the rendered cards because during the process of program I found it to use space better. They are smaller and use the 'Append' feature to load individual data to the user which is better for user interaction.

2. I used different color for my website dude to experimentation and research. I found that the color scheme chosen is more attractive to users. 

3. I changed the search to also include ingredients and the filter is now represented as a series of checkboxes instead. This was because i found it simpler to give the user a straightforward option and filter on category.

4. I added a footer as it is more fitting for a website to have one
